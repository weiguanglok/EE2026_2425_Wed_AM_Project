2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ai_sel/ai_sel/success_reg_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ai_sel/ai_sel/success_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ai_sel/ai_sel/success_reg_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ai_sel/ai_sel/success_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
